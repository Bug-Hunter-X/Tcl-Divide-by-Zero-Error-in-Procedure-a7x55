This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates a potential divide-by-zero error. The file "bug.tcl" shows the erroneous code, and "bugSolution.tcl" provides a corrected version. The issue arises from the lack of error handling when the first argument is zero, leading to an unhandled exception. The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Tcl procedures.
